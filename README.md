# Operating Systems
### This is the lab assignments for the course "Operating Systems" from the University of Toronto.


## Assignment 1: Hijacking System Calls
Hijack (intercept) system calls by writing and installing a basic kernel module to the Linux Kernel.  


## Assignment 2: Synchronization
Use mutexes to simulate a crossroad, where cars may arrive and leave in all directions.


## Assignment 3: Page Tables and Replacement Algorithms
1. Implememt a virtual-to-physical address translation and demand paging using a two-level page table.
2. Implement four different page replacement algorithms:
	* FIFO
	* Clock
	* Exact LRU
	* OPT (given the traces)


## Assignment 4: The Ext2 File System
Explore the implementation of the ext2 file system. Write tools to modify ext2-format virtual disks. Functions to implement includes:
* ls: List all files
* mkdir: Make an empty directory
* cp: Copy file (or directory recursively)
* rm: Remove file (or directory recursively) 
* ln: Create soft/hard link
* restore: Restore a file (or directory recursively) if possible
* checker: Detect file system inconsistencies and fix them.
